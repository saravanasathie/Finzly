Encapsulation and Access Control: 
	You are designing a banking application. Create a class BankAccount with private properties like accountNumber, balance, and ownerName. 
Provide public methods for depositing, withdrawing, and getting the balance. Implement encapsulation by restricting direct access to the properties and using public methods to interact with them.
