**Problem Statement: Building an Inheritance-based Employee System in Java**

**Background:**
		You have been assigned the task of designing a Java program that explores the concept of 
inheritance in the context of an employee management system. Inheritance allows you to create 
specialized classes that inherit attributes and methods from a base class. The program should 
showcase how inheritance can be used to model different types of employees with shared and 
distinct characteristics.

**Problem Description:**
	Develop a Java program that demonstrates inheritance by creating a hierarchy of employees in an 
organization.

**Requirements:**
	1. **Employee Classes:**
 		Create a base class named `Employee` with the following attributes:
 			- `id`: An integer representing the employee's unique identifier.
 			- `name`: A string representing the employee's name.
		Implement methods for getting and setting these attributes.
	
	2. **Derived Classes:**
 		Implement the following derived classes that inherit from the `Employee` class:
 			- `Manager`: A class representing managers. Add an attribute `department` to store the 
				department they manage.
 			- `Developer`: A class representing developers. Add an attribute `programmingLanguage` to store 
				the primary programming language they use.

	3. **User Interaction:**
		Create a simple user interface where users can create instances of the `Manager` and `Developer` 
		classes. Allow users to input attributes like name, id, department (for managers), and programming 
		language (for developers). Display the details of each employee and 

	4. **target**
		Illustrate the hierarchy of the employee classes, emphasizing the parent-child relationship between 
		`Employee`, `Manager`, and `Developer`
