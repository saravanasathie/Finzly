final and constructor : 
	Design an application where we need to have more than one constructor in a class. 
The final value of productKey should activate the antivirus for all clients who purchased the antivirus and those who not purchased they should get the message saying - "You are using free version, please upgrade"

Remember : Transaction class should be there to process the transaction. Once the transaction done, then and then productKey should be approved. 
Else msg should be displayed saying - " Transaction is not done - please pay first to activate product key"
