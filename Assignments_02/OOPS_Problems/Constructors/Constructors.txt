**Problem Statement: 
	Exploring Constructors in Java**

**Background:**
	You have been assigned a task to create a Java program that delves into the concept of constructors. 
Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects when they are created. The program 
should demonstrate how constructors work and how they can be used to set up object states.

**Problem Description:**
	Develop a Java program that illustrates the use of constructors by modeling a simple student 
information system.

**Requirements:**
	
	1. **Class Definition:**
		Define a class named `Student` with the following attributes:
		- `name`: A string representing the student's name.
		- `age`: An integer representing the student's age.
		- `studentId`: A unique identifier for each student.
	
	2. **Constructors:**
		Implement the following constructors for the `Student` class:
		- A default constructor that initializes the student's name as "Unknown", age as 0, and assigns a 
		unique student ID.
		- A parameterized constructor that accepts the student's name and age and assigns a unique 
		student ID.
		- Overload the parameterized constructor to also accept the student's age.
	
	3. **User Interaction:**
		Create a simple user interface where users can create instances of the `Student` class using 
	    different constructors. Allow users to input the student's name and age, and display the student's
	    details.
