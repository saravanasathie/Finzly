**Problem Statement: Implementing Polymorphism in Java**

**Background:**
    You have been given the task of designing and implementing a Java program that showcases the
    concept of polymorphism. The program should emphasize the ability of different objects to respond
    to the same method calls in distinct ways based on their individual implementations.

**Problem Description:**
    Develop a Java program that demonstrates polymorphism by creating a set of shapes and performing
various calculations and operations on them using a common interface.

**Requirements:**
    1. **Interface and Classes:**
        Define an interface called `Shape` with methods like `calculateArea()` and `calculatePerimeter()`.
        Implement this interface in the following classes:
            - `Circle`: A class representing a circle with attributes like radius.
            - `Rectangle`: A class representing a rectangle with attributes like width and height.
            - `Triangle`: A class representing a triangle with attributes like base and height.

    2. **Polymorphism:**
        Create an array or collection of `Shape` objects that includes instances of `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and
        `Triangle`. Demonstrate polymorphism by iterating through this collection and calling the
        `calculateArea()` and `calculatePerimeter()` methods on each object, even though they are of
        different types
