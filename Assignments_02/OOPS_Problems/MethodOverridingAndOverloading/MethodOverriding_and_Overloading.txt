Method Overriding and Overloading : 
	Build a reservation system for a hotel. Create a class Room with properties like roomNumber, capacity, and pricePerNight. Implement methods to check availability and make a reservation. Override the toString() method to provide a customized string representation of a room. Implement method overloading for reservation methods to handle different scenarios, like reserving with or without specific check-in/ check-out dates.
