Class Inheritance and Polymorphism: 
	You are building a system for a zoo. Create a base class Animal with properties like name and age, and a method makeSound(). Derive classes like Lion, Elephant, and Giraffe from Animal, each with their specific sound implementation. Implement a zoo class to manage a collection of animals. Demonstrate polymorphism by iterating through the collection and calling the makeSound() method for each animal.
